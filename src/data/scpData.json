        "image": "./images/scp002.jpeg",
        "procedures": "SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times to keep it in a docile and placated state. At all times, two armed guards are to remain in front of the enclosure to prevent any attempts by personnel to enter the enclosure. No personnel below Level 3 are allowed within SCP-002's enclosure. The following objects require prior approval of at least two Level 4 personnel before contact is allowed with SCP-002: any living organism, any sacred religious objects, any media containing written or recorded information.",
        "description": "SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.",
        "reference": "To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven personnel. It has also in its time at the facility further furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag chair, three books in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a variety of lab animals including higher primates have failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to produce any effect. Whatever process the subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings is apparently only facilitated by the introduction of living humans.",
        "discovery": "Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal where it struck the Earth from orbit. Encased in a shell of thick rock, the fleshy exterior of the object was exposed by the impact. A native farmer happened upon the site and reported his findings to the village elder. Subject gained SCP attention when a Level 4 agent posted in the area detected a small radioactive anomaly generated by the object."

No contact with SCP-003-1 is allowed without prior approval of at least two Level 4 personnel. In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in a controlled temperature increase of the containment area to at least 140°C. All personnel must evacuate containment area until the temperature has returned to acceptable levels.",
        "description": "SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2. SCP-003-1 appears to be a stone tablet with runic inscriptions, of which only about 10% are decipherable. SCP-003-2 is a biological organism of unknown origin, composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown mammals. It is currently dormant and shows no signs of activity except under specific conditions.",

Only personnel with Level 4 security clearance may handle the keys. Under no circumstances should SCP-004-1 be opened without prior approval of at least two Level 4 personnel. Any personnel lost due to SCP-004 are to be considered lost with extreme prejudice.",
        "description": "SCP-004 consists of an old wooden barn door (SCP-004-1) and a set of twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13).

Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area.",
        "description": "In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock, be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease.",
        "notes": "SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but only under the supervision of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel. SCP-005 may not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers, or for any personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the compound will result in immediate termination."

All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance.",
        "description": "SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water but has the unusual property of 'health'. Ingesting the liquid produces remarkable regenerative properties in human beings including DNA repair, heightened cellular duplication, improved tissue repair, and vastly improved immune system effectiveness."

Surveillance cameras are to be installed and monitored at all times. The subject requires no special diet beyond standard nutritional needs. Unauthorized personnel are not allowed to enter SCP-007’s containment area without prior approval from Level 4 personnel.",
        "description": "SCP-007 is a man approximately 25 years old, 176 cm in height, and 70 kg in weight. Instead of a normal abdomen, SCP-007 possesses a hollow cavity containing what appears to be a miniature, self-sustaining ecosystem resembling a small terrestrial globe. This 'miniature world' is about 60 cm in diameter and appears to function as an actual planetary system, with weather patterns, clouds, vegetation, and tiny organisms visible within it. The subject claims no discomfort from this anomaly and otherwise functions like a normal human.",
        "history": "SCP-007 was discovered in ████████, Germany, when local authorities reported a 'man with a hole in his body.' The Foundation intervened, and SCP-007 was secured without resistance. Medical analysis revealed that the cavity has no connection to the subject’s circulatory or digestive systems. Despite the anomalous condition, the subject maintains full health and shows no abnormalities aside from the absence of abdominal organs. The subject has expressed mild irritation at containment but generally cooperates with staff."
